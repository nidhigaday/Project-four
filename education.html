        I love learning new things and studying. In my opinion, you can learn from anywhere although, formal education has its own importance.

        <p>I have also completed some Online courses that I would like to mention:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001" target="_blank">Front-End NanoDegree</a>
                <p>I am currently enrolled in this program. I have gained conceptual understanding of making a code of webpage more simple and efficient to update.</p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript" target="_blank">Javascript Road Trip</a>
                <p>I am glad I took this online course at Code School. Considering Javascript one of the efficient languages, it was highly difficult for me to match all the aspects of Javascripts into one piece. I took this course, I went o one topic at a time and worked on practice webpages to make my understanding stronger. Curently I am learning the Object-oriented Javascript.</p>
